        <h3>Accommodation</h3>
        For this weekend, we have for ourselves a gorgeous house of 206m&sup2.<br>
            <li>üè†D≈Øm Nad ≈òekou - The house is divided in 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, living room and kitchen.</li>
            <li>üì±You can find them on social media as well: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dum_nad_rekou_znojmo?igsh=dnlrZm0xM3dsNjNn">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100095188870061">Facebook</a></li>
            <li>üìçIt is located at ≈Ωleby 556/9, 669 02 Znojmo 2.</li>
            <li>üöåFor those of us who arrive by bus, it is a 15 minutes walk to the accommodation.</li>
            <li>üöóFor those of us who arrive by car, please read the following instructions given to me by the owner of the accommodation:</li>
            <p><i>A few minutes before arriving at D≈Øm Nad ≈òekou, you pass a sign indicating limited access. This sign does not apply to you, as guests, as according to the regulation, you fall under the category of "transportation service", and therefore you can continue driving without any hesitation.</p><img src="parking1.png" width="1000">
            
            <p>Upon arrival, you can park your car in our garage, which will be available to you throughout your all stay.
            There is a small parking area in front of the house where you can park another car if necessary. We kindly ask you to be considerate and park in a way that allows the passage of other cars.</p>

            <p>We also have an unwritten rule on our parking area. Our neighbour, Mr. Smol√≠k, likes to park his car in front of his garage. Although he doesn't have any right to that spot, we let him and ourselves have peace and try not to park in "his" place.</p>

            <p>We also do not recommend parking directly in front of our garage, as it restricts the comfortable maneuvering of other cars. On the plan below, it is marked in green where and in which direction to park, so that the parked cars do not restrict each other.</p>

            <p>Please park the third and subsequent vehicles outside of ≈Ωleby Street. You can park on designated paid parking lots or in adjacent streets (e.g. Dyjsk√° Street) - in places that are not reserved for residents.</p> <img src="parking2.png" width="1000">
